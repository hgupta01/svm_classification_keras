# svm_classification_keras
This repo contain an example of classification of MNIST Dataset using linear SVM following the paper below usig Keras with TF backend.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0239

The loss fuction used in this example for multi-class classification is usef from following website.

I also implemented the exapmle in Tensorflow (using tf.data.Dataset) but training is slow and better example are available on github.
