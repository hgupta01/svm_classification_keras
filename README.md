# svm_classification_keras
This repo contains an example of MNIST Data classification using linear SVM following the paper below using Keras with TF backend.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0239

The loss function used is [multi-class classification](http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/).

I also implemented the example in Tensorflow (using tf.data.Dataset), but training is slow, and better examples are available on GitHub ([svm_layer](https://github.com/nwWag/Tensorflow-Snippets/blob/master/svm_layer), and [cnn_svm](https://github.com/AFAgarap/cnn-svm/blob/master/model/cnn_svm.py)).
